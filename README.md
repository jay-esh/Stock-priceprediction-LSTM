# Stock-priceprediction-LSTM
I made a stock market prediction algorithm using LSTM

I compared the results of this project with results from my [nlp-analysis](https://github.com/jay-esh/nlp-sentiment-analysis) project and plotted the predictions along with the actual data on a single graph

You can find out that I used my nlp-analysis code at the last cell of the jupyter notebook
